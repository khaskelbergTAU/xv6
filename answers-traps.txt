a0-a7 registers hold function arguments, a2 holds the 13 in mains call to printf.
there is no call, the compiler inserted the value of f(8) + 1 which is 12.
printf is located at 0x642, as we can see by the fact that the call to printf is the sequence
auipc ra,0x0
jalr 1554(ra)
which means move pc to ra which means ra is 0x30, and then the offset 1554 is added to it and jumped to
1554 + 0x30 = 0x642

the value will be 0x38, which is 0x34 + 4 since thats the address of the jalr instruction.

the code will output He11o World, since the hex value of 57616 is 0xe110
and the bytes of i when written in little endian are 0x72, 0x6c, 0x63, 0x00 which is r, l, d and the null byte that terminates C strings
if the machine was big endian, 57616 wouldnt need to be changed since it would be the same value, and i would nee to become 0x726c6400

the value printed is going to be whatever was in a2 when the function was called - 
probably the third argument to the previous function that took at least three variables that was called
